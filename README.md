# Web Development Learning Journey üåê

Welcome to my Web Development Learning repository! This space is where I dive into various web technologies, frameworks, and tools as I build skills to become a proficient front-end developer. Here, you‚Äôll find a range of projects, experiments, and notes that cover different aspects of modern web development.

## About This Repository

This repo serves as my learning sandbox where I explore and practice:
- **HTML5** and **CSS3** basics to layout and style web pages
- **JavaScript** fundamentals and advanced concepts
- **React.js** and its ecosystem, including hooks, context, and state management
- **MERN stack** components for building full-stack applications
- Other **frontend tools and libraries** as I progress, like Redux, GraphQL, and EJS

## Goals üéØ

1. Build a solid foundation in front-end development and design.
2. Learn to integrate front-end and back-end code effectively.
3. Develop real-world, problem-solving skills through projects.
4. Document progress and learnings along the way.
